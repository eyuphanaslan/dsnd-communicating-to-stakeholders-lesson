## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
2. What factors about an individual contributed to salary?
3. How bias played a role in the suggestions of developers for how to break into the field?
4. What was the state of bootcamps for assisting individuals with breaking into developer roles?
5. How were bootcamps assisting with increasing diversity in tech careers?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks and one Python script used to explore the Stack Overflow 2017 survey data and answer the project questions.

- `1_Data_Exploration.ipynb`  
  This notebook focuses on exploring the Stack Overflow survey dataset, cleaning relevant variables, and understanding general trends related to education background, experience, and salary.

- `2_Bias_And_Diversity.ipynb`  
  This notebook investigates potential bias in developer recommendations and examines how diversity-related factors (such as gender and background) influence suggestions for breaking into the tech field.

- `3_Bootcamps_And_Career_Paths.ipynb`  
  This notebook analyzes the role of bootcamps in helping individuals enter developer roles and explores how bootcamps contribute to career transitions and diversity in tech.

- `salary_model.py`  
  This Python script contains the functions and modeling logic used to build and evaluate a predictive model for estimating developer salary based on individual characteristics.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
